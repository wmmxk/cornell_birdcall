Where you left: you were looking into the inference code.

Test for each module is in the following folder
kaggle-birdsong-recognition/src/test/test_sed_denseattmodel.py



The two layer for loops, the inner loop should be the outer loop. kaggle-birdsong-recognition/src/test/cornell-birdcall-identification-1st-place-solution.py:998
 The key represents a model, and the value is a list of df, each df holds all the predictions of an audio.

This prediction problem is like object detection. Here object is an event (a birdcall). When ensemble the prediction
  by multiple model, we need to name each event by site_id_audio_id and start_section/cur_section. If the same events
  are predicted by multiple models, use a threshold to determine it is really a positive or not.

High level backbone:
1. clipwise prediction, framewise prediction.
   Extract each event along the frame dimesion is like object detection. There is a postprocessing process.
2. Ensemble the prediction of multiple models.
3.
