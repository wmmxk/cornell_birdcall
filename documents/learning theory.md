When a problem comes to your horizon, you start to learn a new subject to solve the problem. At this point,
you can not even ask educated good questions to solve the problem.

In the first stage, the goal is to from (4) to (2). In this stage, questions come to your mind, but you don't 
the answer.

After a while, when you piece up everything, (2) becomes (1).

    You know you know (1)      | you know you don't know (2)
---------------------- --------|--------------------------------
   you don't know you know (3) | you don't know you don't know (4)
